`$ whoami`: Robotics & AI Student and Researcher
----------------------------------------------

Since I graduated from **Ecole 42** programming school, I have been involved in many engineering projects: from AI-based facial recognition authentication system to programming and bringing scientific CubeSat satellites to space. 
Equipped with strong foundation in software engineering, electronics, maker skills, and passion for complex systems, math & engineering, I followed my drive to study **Robotics & AI**. Currently I am in my final semester as a **Bachelor student in Austria**.

Aside from studies, I am actively involved in **Robotics research**. My interests lie in Robotic Manipulation, Tactile Sensing, Haptics, Representation Learning, applied multi-modal Machine Learning in sensing and perception, Human-Robot Interaction and Bio-Inspired Mechatronics.

I am the leader of the **RGMC 2026 (Robotic Grasping & Manipulation Competition) Klagenfurt team**.
